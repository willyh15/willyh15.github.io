# 👋 Hey, I'm Will Harrison — Full Stack · DevOps · Cybersecurity

Welcome to my interactive portfolio — built to showcase the work I’ve done across automation, security, backend infrastructure, and iOS low-level engineering. This site is powered by modern HTML + Lit + GitHub Actions and is fully synced with my public repositories.

> 🛠️ I'm currently focused on projects that blend:
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity** — iOS jailbreaking, system tweaks, stealth tooling
- ⚙️ **DevOps** — GitHub Actions, self-hosted infra, monitoring/automation
- 💻 **Full Stack Development** — from Svelte + SQLite to Python + CLI tools
